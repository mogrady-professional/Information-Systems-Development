The Dough Bros Pizza Order, Delivery and Management System is a project developed using the Agile and Waterfall methodologies to improve business processes and drive a digital transformation. The project itself consisted of a C# ASP.NET website in the form of an Microsoft Azure Web-App connected to an Virtual Machine with a MS SQL Server with Microsoft PowerApps integration for the management of data and functions.

# Project Description

The project mostly consisted of a realistic software development project which included business analysis phases such as; Feasibility studies, Requirements catalog's, Functional/Non-functional requirements, Organisational Chart's, Context Diagrams, Use Case Diagram, Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), Data Flow Diagram's (DFD 0, 1 & 2), Business Process Model (BMP), Rich Picture, Sequence Diagrams, System Diagrams, Data Dictionary.

The Implementation plan and schedule in terms of Jira/Gantt Chart to include GDPR, training and change management and data governance. The build aspect required a working prototype of a system.

The final project I developed is a ASP.NET web app website which provides an online presence for the company and allows new customers to order a pizza online by filling out a JavaScript form and submitting the form to our SQL Server hosted in Microsoft Azure. The order is submitted to the SQL server and the data (order and business information) is accessible and received by staff through a Microsoft PowerApp I developed for the staff to manage the orders. Further functionality exists on the PowerApp to manage other functions for the business such as managing reservations, the menu, costing and more, allowing centralised storage and accessability on the Azure Cloud.
